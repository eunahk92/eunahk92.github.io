# eunahk92.github.io - Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, this project's objective is to develop a functional, responsive portfolio that utilizes Bootstrap's grid system and minimizes the use of media queries. This portfolio consists of 3 major aspects: about me, portfolio, and contact. As the UCF Bootcamp progresses, this project will be modified to reflect my progress.
